      "# HOW IT WORKS:\n",
      "\n",
      "# Buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve reinvented the typical months-long ordeal of buying a home and streamlined every part of it. You can spend time in your new home to see how it feels and then buy it online instantly, safely, and securely. We’ll guide you through each step, from choosing the right home and getting financing to completing the purchase online at your own pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Move in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each new 0001 home is fully equipped with all the furniture, appliances, and home essentials you’ll need. Developed in collaboration with world-class architects, every detail has been thoughtfully designed, so you can truly move in with nothing but your suitcase.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Swap.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOME0001 is a peer-to-peer housing collective. Members of the collective get access to 0001 homes in other locations, so you can spend time in other places for free while making your home available to other members while you’re away.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Total control.\n",
      "\n",
      "You own your home outright. You're 100% in control, just like owning any other home. It’s your call whether you make your home available to other members of the collective, and you’re free to rent or sell your home however and whenever you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "# FAQ:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Do I own my 0001 home outright?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Owning a 0001 home is no different than when purchasing any other property. HOME0001 is distinguished by a commitment to meticulous and cohesive design with the added benefit of access to our network of homes so you can spend time in similar properties around the world for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Do I need a broker?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, you don't need a real estate broker to buy a 0001 home. We’re licensed to guide you through the process from beginning to end. You can use your own mortgage broker, real estate attorney, etc., or we can introduce you to our network of vetted professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Is furniture included?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, each new home comes fully furnished and equipped so that you can move in easily with just your suitcase. Each interior is designed for flexibility and functionality and we work directly with designers from our community to source pieces often straight from their studios.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Do I have to make my home available?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, that’s entirely optional. There's no requirement to make your home available to other members unless you specifically want to take advantage of staying at another 0001 home for free during that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Can I change the design of my 0001 home?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely! You are free to change, renovate, or even remodel your home as you see fit.However, for continued access to HOME0001's network in other locations, your home does need to meet our standards and our team will be happy to support you in making changes where desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How do I book a 0001 home somewhere else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever you want to spend time in other HOME0001 locations, just text us your dates and we'll confirm availability. You cover one cleaning fee each time you swap homes and don't pay any nightly rates. 0001 homes are fitted with smart locks, so you can gain access to your new place with your phone. You’ll be invited to any community events that are taking place locally and you’ll have continual access to our virtual concierge service so you can text us whenever you need anything.\n",

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury.

Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\n",

If you are unable to accept these Deposit Terms, you will not be able to make the Deposit. We may decline Deposits to avoid over-subscription or as we deem appropriate at our sole discretion. If your Deposit is declined, you will be notified, and your Deposit payment will be refunded.\n",

      "Please note that these Deposit Terms only apply to the Deposit and are not applicable in the event you, in the future, finalize a purchase of a 0001 home. The final purchase of a 0001 home will be governed by a separate final sales agreement, which will include separate terms and conditions. Additionally, your relationship with Home0001 will be governed by a separate User Agreement. Additional payment for a 0001 home, including taxes and other governmental fees, will be required at that time.\n",

Home0001 may choose to take a Waitlist Deposit in the future, at Home0001’s discretion. Upon finalizing a Waitlist Deposit, you will be placed on the waitlist for any future drops of available 0001 homes. Home0001 will update you as homes become available.\n",

You may cancel your Waitlist Deposit and request a refund at any time by contacting Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact​. We reserve the right to cancel your Waitlist Deposit and issue a full refund of your Waitlist Deposit at any time. The Waitlist Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home with priority over other customers.\n",

      "**3\\. Reservation Deposit Terms**\n",

      "A Reservation Deposit is an order to secure your reservation for a specific 0001 home. Should you be interested in purchasing a 0001 home available pursuant to a drop from Home0001, a complete Reservation Deposit secures your approximate priority in being invited to complete your purchase of such home. Home0001 will use reasonable efforts to invite you to finalize the purchase of the 0001 home when it is available for sale, and the Reservation Deposit will be a deposit towards payment for said 0001 home.

No amendment, modification, or waiver of these Deposit Terms will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by Home0001. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in these Deposit Terms is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision (1) will be automatically construed and adjusted in a manner which enables it to be valid and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law and which most nearly effects the parties’ intent in entering into these Deposit Terms, and (2) will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of these Deposit Terms.\n",

      "**Applicable Law and Venue.** These Deposit Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its [Consumer Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf), as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\n",
