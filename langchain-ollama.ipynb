You're 100% in control, just like owning any other home. It’s your call whether you make your home available to other members of the collective, and you’re free to rent or sell your home however and whenever you like.FAQ:Do I own my 0001 home outright?Yes.

Each interior is designed for flexibility and functionality and we work directly with designers from our community to source pieces often straight from their studios.Do I have to make my home available?No, that’s entirely optional.

You are free to change, renovate, or even remodel your home as you see fit. However, for continued access to HOME0001's network in other locations, your home does need to meet our standards and our team will be happy to support you in making changes where desired.How do I book a 0001 home somewhere else?Whenever you want to spend time in other HOME0001 locations, just text us your dates and we'll confirm availability.
