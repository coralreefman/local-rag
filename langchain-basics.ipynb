Upon any such termination or suspension, your right to use the Site will immediately cease, and Home0001 may, without liability to you or any third party, immediately deactivate or delete your username, password and account, and all associated materials, without any obligation to provide any further access to such materials. Sections 2-5, 7-10, and 12–24 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.20. CHOICE OF LAW; ARBITRATIONThis Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action.The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.21.

Should you be interested in purchasing a 0001 home available pursuant to a drop from Home0001, a complete Reservation Deposit secures your approximate priority in being invited to complete your purchase of such home. Home0001 will use reasonable efforts to invite you to finalize the purchase of the 0001 home when it is available for sale, and the Reservation Deposit will be a deposit towards payment for said 0001 home. If you do not complete the final purchase of said 0001 home within a reasonable period of time, we may extend an invitation to purchase said home to the next individual.Upon receiving notice of an available 0001 home pursuant to a drop and your confirmation, in accordance with the policy and procedures identified and described in the Home0001 website, of your intent to purchase such property, Home0001 will assist you as the “Buyer” in its dual-agency capacity to its fullest extent to make the process as friendly and efficient as possible.

Please note that the Reservation Deposit is non-refundable upon any such cancellation.

No amendment, modification, or waiver of these Deposit Terms will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by Home0001. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in these Deposit Terms is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision (1) will be automatically construed and adjusted in a manner which enables it to be valid and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law and which most nearly effects the parties’ intent in entering into these Deposit Terms, and (2) will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of these Deposit Terms.Assignment.

These Deposit Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.Entire Agreement. These Deposit Terms, your Deposit Confirmation, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy will constitute the entire agreement between you and Home0001 with respect to the matters contained in these Deposit Terms, and will supersede any other prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral or written agreements, understandings or communications relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between these Deposit Terms, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy, these Deposit Terms shall prevail.Printed Agreement.

Reservation Deposit TermsA Reservation Deposit is an order to secure your reservation for a specific 0001 home.

Home0001 will use reasonable efforts to invite you to finalize the purchase of the 0001 home when it is available for sale, and the Reservation Deposit will be a deposit towards payment for said 0001 home.

Force MajeureHome0001’s obligations under these Deposit Terms will be suspended to the extent that it is wholly or partially precluded from complying with its obligations under these Deposit Terms by force majeure. Force majeure includes, but is not restricted to fire, storm, flood, Home0001quake, explosion, accident, act of the public enemy, war, rebellion, insurrection, sabotage, outbreak, epidemic, public health emergency, quarantine restriction, labor dispute, labor shortage, transportation embargo or failure, curtailment or delay in transportation, act of God, act (including laws, regulations, orders, advisories, disapprovals or failure to approve) of any government or public health agency or authority, whether national, statewide, municipal, or otherwise, or any other event or circumstance beyond Home0001’s reasonable control.10. GeneralPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service. The data Home0001 collects from you will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and available on our website at www.home0001.com/legal/#privacy-policy and www.home0001.com/legal/#terms-of-service. Please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service carefully to understand the data that we collect and our practices regarding your information and how it will be treated. If you have questions, you may contact Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact​.No Waiver; Amendments; Severability. The failure of Home0001 to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the provisions of these Deposit Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provisions. No amendment, modification, or waiver of these Deposit Terms will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by Home0001. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in these Deposit Terms is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision (1) will be automatically construed and adjusted in a manner which enables it to be valid and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law and which most nearly effects the parties’ intent in entering into these Deposit Terms, and (2) will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of these Deposit Terms.Assignment. You may not assign (directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) or delegate these Deposit Terms or your rights or obligations under these Deposit Terms without the written consent of Home0001. Any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Home0001 may freely assign and delegate these Deposit Terms and these Deposit Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of Home0001’s successors and assigns, including without limitation, any entity into which Home0001 will merge or consolidate. Any assignment in violation of these Deposit Terms will be null and void.Applicable Law and Venue. These Deposit Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.Entire Agreement. These Deposit Terms, your Deposit Confirmation, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy will constitute the entire agreement between you and Home0001 with respect to the matters contained in these Deposit Terms, and will supersede any other prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral or written agreements, understandings or communications relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between these Deposit Terms, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy, these Deposit Terms shall prevail.Printed Agreement. A printed version of these Deposit Terms and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Deposit Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.CONTACTING USHOME0001 International Inc., located at 80 State St., Albany, NY 12207 United States, is the company responsible for collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, Website Terms and Services, or Deposit Terms and Services, please contact us at collective@home0001.com.Because email communications are not always secure, please do not include credit card or other sensitive information in your emails to us.© 2024 HOME0001New york · los angeles · berlin · london · paris · mexico city0001 GDShow it workscontact usInstagramlegalCookies Settings© 2024 HOME0001NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #01427385NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #02236922WE USE COOKIES.Accept/Reject/Settings\n"

The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector database (or vector store). When we want to search over our splits, we take a text search query, embed it, and perform some sort of “similarity” search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity — we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are high dimensional vectors)."

Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision.

Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator.

By clicking to accept or agree to these terms when this option is made available to you, you agree to be bound by these Deposit Terms.1. IntroductionYou are agreeing to these Deposit Terms to (a) secure your spot on the waitlist to purchase a 0001 home (“Waitlist Deposit”), or (b) place a reservation for a specific 0001 home (“Reservation Deposit”) (either a Waitlist Deposit or a Reservation Deposit, a “Deposit”). If you are unable to accept these Deposit Terms, you will not be able to make the Deposit. We may decline Deposits to avoid over-subscription or as we deem appropriate at our sole discretion. If your Deposit is declined, you will be notified, and your Deposit payment will be refunded.Please note that these Deposit Terms only apply to the Deposit and are not applicable in the event you, in the future, finalize a purchase of a 0001 home. The final purchase of a 0001 home will be governed by a separate final sales agreement, which will include separate terms and conditions. Additionally, your relationship with Home0001 will be governed by a separate User Agreement. Additional payment for a 0001 home, including taxes and other governmental fees, will be required at that time.2. Waitlist Deposit TermsA Waitlist Deposit is a preliminary, non-binding order which entitles you to be a prioritized buyer when a 0001 home is available for sale in your chosen location. Home0001 may choose to take a Waitlist Deposit in the future, at Home0001’s discretion. Upon finalizing a Waitlist Deposit, you will be placed on the waitlist for any future drops of available 0001 homes. Home0001 will update you as homes become available.The Waitlist Deposit is fully refundable to you should you choose to remove yourself from the waitlist. You may cancel your Waitlist Deposit and request a refund at any time by contacting Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact\\u200b. We reserve the right to cancel your Waitlist Deposit and issue a full refund of your Waitlist Deposit at any time. The Waitlist Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home with priority over other customers.3. Reservation Deposit TermsA Reservation Deposit is an order to secure your reservation for a specific 0001 home. Should you be interested in purchasing a 0001 home available pursuant to a drop from Home0001, a complete Reservation Deposit secures your approximate priority in being invited to complete your purchase of such home. Home0001 will use reasonable efforts to invite you to finalize the purchase of the 0001 home when it is available for sale, and the Reservation Deposit will be a deposit towards payment for said 0001 home. If you do not complete the final purchase of said 0001 home within a reasonable period of time, we may extend an invitation to purchase said home to the next individual.Upon receiving notice of an available 0001 home pursuant to a drop and your confirmation, in accordance with the policy and procedures identified and described in the Home0001 website, of your intent to purchase such property, Home0001 will assist you as the “Buyer” in its dual-agency capacity to its fullest extent to make the process as friendly and efficient as possible. You will be required to execute and return a Disclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationship in connection with your Reservation Deposit.You may cancel your reservation at any time by contacting Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact. Please note that the Reservation Deposit is non-refundable upon any such cancellation. We reserve the right to cancel your Reservation Deposit and issue a full refund of your Reservation Deposit at any time. The Reservation Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home.4. No Obligations; Disclaimer of WarrantiesYou are under no obligation to purchase a 0001 home, and we are under no obligation to supply you with a 0001 home. These Deposit Terms do not constitute a purchase agreement or other order for the sale of a 0001 home to you.Home0001 makes no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity or timeliness of any listings, descriptions or images (including any features, specifications and prices contained therein) provided by Home0001 for 0001 homes in its digital channels.

Deposit Eligibility; Representations and WarrantiesBy agreeing to these Deposit Terms and placing a Deposit, you represent and warrant to us that (a) you are at least 18 years of age, (b) all information you provide is accurate, and (c) you understand that the specifications and availability of any 0001 homes are subject to change at Home0001’s discretion. It is your responsibility to keep all information you provide current at any time by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact. We shall not be liable for inaccurate or outdated information. You further represent and warrant that you are not a person, or acting on behalf of a person, designated on any sanctions list imposed by the UN, EU or US. If at any time these representations fail to be true, your Deposit and Membership will automatically terminate with immediate effect, without any liability to compensate you whatsoever. Furthermore, according to law, we may not be able to repay your Deposit Amount payment.6. Deposit PaymentYou will be charged the fee indicated (the “Deposit Amount”) when you place your Waitlist Deposit or Reservation Deposit, as applicable. Placing a Deposit constitutes your express agreement to be charged the Deposit Amount using your provided payment method.You may be asked to supply certain relevant information, such as your credit card number and its expiration date, your billing address and your shipping information.

By submitting such information, you grant to us the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating such Deposit. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Deposit.After you have finalized your Deposit, you will receive a receipt confirming that your Deposit has been received and completed (“Deposit Confirmation”). Please save the Deposit Confirmation as this will be used when you have the opportunity to purchase your 0001 home. If you do not receive the Deposit Confirmation within four (4) hours of completing the online process, please contact us by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact.7. AcknowledgementsYou understand that (a) Home0001 will not hold your Deposit separately or in an escrow or trust fund, and (b) Home0001 will not pay any interest on any Deposit except to the extent required by law.8. Limitation of LiabilityExcept to the extent prohibited by applicable law, in no event will (a) Home0001 have any obligation or liability, whether arising in contract (including warranty), tort (including active, passive, or imputed negligence, strict liability, or product liability, but excluding willful misconduct) or otherwise, for any special, consequential, punitive, incidental, or indirect damages, or for loss of use, loss of revenue, loss of business, lost profit, costs of procurement of substitute goods, or other financial loss arising out of or in connection with any product or other goods or services furnished under these Deposit Terms or any other agreement signed by the parties, regardless of whether or not Home0001 was aware of the possibility of the same, and (b) Home0001’s aggregate liability in connection with these Deposit Terms or products exceed the total amounts actually received by Home0001 from you hereunder.9. Force MajeureHome0001’s obligations under these Deposit Terms will be suspended to the extent that it is wholly or partially precluded from complying with its obligations under these Deposit Terms by force majeure. Force majeure includes, but is not restricted to fire, storm, flood, Home0001quake, explosion, accident, act of the public enemy, war, rebellion, insurrection, sabotage, outbreak, epidemic, public health emergency, quarantine restriction, labor dispute, labor shortage, transportation embargo or failure, curtailment or delay in transportation, act of God, act (including laws, regulations, orders, advisories, disapprovals or failure to approve) of any government or public health agency or authority, whether national, statewide, municipal, or otherwise, or any other event or circumstance beyond Home0001’s reasonable control.10. GeneralPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service. The data Home0001 collects from you will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and available on our website at www.home0001.com/legal/#privacy-policy and www.home0001.com/legal/#terms-of-service. Please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service carefully to understand the data that we collect and our practices regarding your information and how it will be treated. If you have questions, you may contact Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact\\u200b.No Waiver; Amendments; Severability. The failure of Home0001 to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the provisions of these Deposit Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provisions. No amendment, modification, or waiver of these Deposit Terms will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by Home0001. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in these Deposit Terms is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision (1) will be automatically construed and adjusted in a manner which enables it to be valid and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law and which most nearly effects the parties’ intent in entering into these Deposit Terms, and (2) will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of these Deposit Terms.Assignment. You may not assign (directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) or delegate these Deposit Terms or your rights or obligations under these Deposit Terms without the written consent of Home0001. Any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Home0001 may freely assign and delegate these Deposit Terms and these Deposit Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of Home0001’s successors and assigns, including without limitation, any entity into which Home0001 will merge or consolidate. Any assignment in violation of these Deposit Terms will be null and void.Applicable Law and Venue. These Deposit Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.Entire Agreement. These Deposit Terms, your Deposit Confirmation, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy will constitute the entire agreement between you and Home0001 with respect to the matters contained in these Deposit Terms, and will supersede any other prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral or written agreements, understandings or communications relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between these Deposit Terms, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy, these Deposit Terms shall prevail.Printed Agreement. A printed version of these Deposit Terms and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Deposit Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.CONTACTING USHOME0001 International Inc., located at 80 State St., Albany, NY 12207 United States, is the company responsible for collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, Website Terms and Services, or Deposit Terms and Services, please contact us at collective@home0001.com.Because email communications are not always secure, please do not include credit card or other sensitive information in your emails to us.© 2024\\xa0HOME0001New york · los angeles · berlin · london · paris · mexico city0001 GDShow it workscontact usInstagramlegalCookies Settings© 2024 HOME0001NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #01427385NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #02236922WE USE COOKIES.Accept/Reject/Settings\\n'})\n",

Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision.

The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.21.

By clicking to accept or agree to these terms when this option is made available to you, you agree to be bound by these Deposit Terms.1. IntroductionYou are agreeing to these Deposit Terms to (a) secure your spot on the waitlist to purchase a 0001 home (“Waitlist Deposit”), or (b) place a reservation for a specific 0001 home (“Reservation Deposit”) (either a Waitlist Deposit or a Reservation Deposit, a “Deposit”). If you are unable to accept these Deposit Terms, you will not be able to make the Deposit. We may decline Deposits to avoid over-subscription or as we deem appropriate at our sole discretion. If your Deposit is declined, you will be notified, and your Deposit payment will be refunded.Please note that these Deposit Terms only apply to the Deposit and are not applicable in the event you, in the future, finalize a purchase of a 0001 home. The final purchase of a 0001 home will be governed by a separate final sales agreement, which will include separate terms and conditions. Additionally, your relationship with Home0001 will be governed by a separate User Agreement. Additional payment for a 0001 home, including taxes and other governmental fees, will be required at that time.2. Waitlist Deposit TermsA Waitlist Deposit is a preliminary, non-binding order which entitles you to be a prioritized buyer when a 0001 home is available for sale in your chosen location. Home0001 may choose to take a Waitlist Deposit in the future, at Home0001’s discretion. Upon finalizing a Waitlist Deposit, you will be placed on the waitlist for any future drops of available 0001 homes. Home0001 will update you as homes become available.The Waitlist Deposit is fully refundable to you should you choose to remove yourself from the waitlist. You may cancel your Waitlist Deposit and request a refund at any time by contacting Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact\\u200b. We reserve the right to cancel your Waitlist Deposit and issue a full refund of your Waitlist Deposit at any time. The Waitlist Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home with priority over other customers.3. Reservation Deposit TermsA Reservation Deposit is an order to secure your reservation for a specific 0001 home. Should you be interested in purchasing a 0001 home available pursuant to a drop from Home0001, a complete Reservation Deposit secures your approximate priority in being invited to complete your purchase of such home. Home0001 will use reasonable efforts to invite you to finalize the purchase of the 0001 home when it is available for sale, and the Reservation Deposit will be a deposit towards payment for said 0001 home. If you do not complete the final purchase of said 0001 home within a reasonable period of time, we may extend an invitation to purchase said home to the next individual.Upon receiving notice of an available 0001 home pursuant to a drop and your confirmation, in accordance with the policy and procedures identified and described in the Home0001 website, of your intent to purchase such property, Home0001 will assist you as the “Buyer” in its dual-agency capacity to its fullest extent to make the process as friendly and efficient as possible. You will be required to execute and return a Disclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationship in connection with your Reservation Deposit.You may cancel your reservation at any time by contacting Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact. Please note that the Reservation Deposit is non-refundable upon any such cancellation. We reserve the right to cancel your Reservation Deposit and issue a full refund of your Reservation Deposit at any time. The Reservation Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home.4. No Obligations; Disclaimer of WarrantiesYou are under no obligation to purchase a 0001 home, and we are under no obligation to supply you with a 0001 home. These Deposit Terms do not constitute a purchase agreement or other order for the sale of a 0001 home to you.Home0001 makes no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity or timeliness of any listings, descriptions or images (including any features, specifications and prices contained therein) provided by Home0001 for 0001 homes in its digital channels.

Please save the Deposit Confirmation as this will be used when you have the opportunity to purchase your 0001 home. If you do not receive the Deposit Confirmation within four (4) hours of completing the online process, please contact us by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact.7. AcknowledgementsYou understand that (a) Home0001 will not hold your Deposit separately or in an escrow or trust fund, and (b) Home0001 will not pay any interest on any Deposit except to the extent required by law.8.

GeneralPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service. The data Home0001 collects from you will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and available on our website at www.home0001.com/legal/#privacy-policy and www.home0001.com/legal/#terms-of-service. Please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service carefully to understand the data that we collect and our practices regarding your information and how it will be treated. If you have questions, you may contact Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact\\u200b.No Waiver; Amendments; Severability. The failure of Home0001 to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the provisions of these Deposit Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provisions. No amendment, modification, or waiver of these Deposit Terms will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by Home0001. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in these Deposit Terms is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision (1) will be automatically construed and adjusted in a manner which enables it to be valid and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law and which most nearly effects the parties’ intent in entering into these Deposit Terms, and (2) will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of these Deposit Terms.Assignment. You may not assign (directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) or delegate these Deposit Terms or your rights or obligations under these Deposit Terms without the written consent of Home0001. Any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Home0001 may freely assign and delegate these Deposit Terms and these Deposit Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of Home0001’s successors and assigns, including without limitation, any entity into which Home0001 will merge or consolidate. Any assignment in violation of these Deposit Terms will be null and void.Applicable Law and Venue. These Deposit Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.Entire Agreement. These Deposit Terms, your Deposit Confirmation, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy will constitute the entire agreement between you and Home0001 with respect to the matters contained in these Deposit Terms, and will supersede any other prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral or written agreements, understandings or communications relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between these Deposit Terms, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy, these Deposit Terms shall prevail.Printed Agreement. A printed version of these Deposit Terms and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Deposit Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.CONTACTING USHOME0001 International Inc., located at 80 State St., Albany, NY 12207 United States, is the company responsible for collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, Website Terms and Services, or Deposit Terms and Services, please contact us at collective@home0001.com.Because email communications are not always secure, please do not include credit card or other sensitive information in your emails to us.© 2024\\xa0HOME0001New york · los angeles · berlin · london · paris · mexico city0001 GDShow it workscontact usInstagramlegalCookies Settings© 2024 HOME0001NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #01427385NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #02236922WE USE COOKIES.Accept/Reject/Settings\\n'}\n"

CHOICE OF LAW; ARBITRATIONThis Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action.The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.21.

We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction.

By clicking to accept or agree to these terms when this option is made available to you, you agree to be bound by these Deposit Terms.1. IntroductionYou are agreeing to these Deposit Terms to (a) secure your spot on the waitlist to purchase a 0001 home (“Waitlist Deposit”), or (b) place a reservation for a specific 0001 home (“Reservation Deposit”) (either a Waitlist Deposit or a Reservation Deposit, a “Deposit”). If you are unable to accept these Deposit Terms, you will not be able to make the Deposit. We may decline Deposits to avoid over-subscription or as we deem appropriate at our sole discretion. If your Deposit is declined, you will be notified, and your Deposit payment will be refunded.Please note that these Deposit Terms only apply to the Deposit and are not applicable in the event you, in the future, finalize a purchase of a 0001 home. The final purchase of a 0001 home will be governed by a separate final sales agreement, which will include separate terms and conditions. Additionally, your relationship with Home0001 will be governed by a separate User Agreement. Additional payment for a 0001 home, including taxes and other governmental fees, will be required at that time.2. Waitlist Deposit TermsA Waitlist Deposit is a preliminary, non-binding order which entitles you to be a prioritized buyer when a 0001 home is available for sale in your chosen location. Home0001 may choose to take a Waitlist Deposit in the future, at Home0001’s discretion. Upon finalizing a Waitlist Deposit, you will be placed on the waitlist for any future drops of available 0001 homes.

The Waitlist Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home with priority over other customers.3. Reservation Deposit TermsA Reservation Deposit is an order to secure your reservation for a specific 0001 home. Should you be interested in purchasing a 0001 home available pursuant to a drop from Home0001, a complete Reservation Deposit secures your approximate priority in being invited to complete your purchase of such home. Home0001 will use reasonable efforts to invite you to finalize the purchase of the 0001 home when it is available for sale, and the Reservation Deposit will be a deposit towards payment for said 0001 home. If you do not complete the final purchase of said 0001 home within a reasonable period of time, we may extend an invitation to purchase said home to the next individual.Upon receiving notice of an available 0001 home pursuant to a drop and your confirmation, in accordance with the policy and procedures identified and described in the Home0001 website, of your intent to purchase such property, Home0001 will assist you as the “Buyer” in its dual-agency capacity to its fullest extent to make the process as friendly and efficient as possible. You will be required to execute and return a Disclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationship in connection with your Reservation Deposit.You may cancel your reservation at any time by contacting Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact. Please note that the Reservation Deposit is non-refundable upon any such cancellation. We reserve the right to cancel your Reservation Deposit and issue a full refund of your Reservation Deposit at any time. The Reservation Deposit does not in any way confirm or guarantee you a right to purchase a 0001 home.4. No Obligations; Disclaimer of WarrantiesYou are under no obligation to purchase a 0001 home, and we are under no obligation to supply you with a 0001 home. These Deposit Terms do not constitute a purchase agreement or other order for the sale of a 0001 home to you.Home0001 makes no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity or timeliness of any listings, descriptions or images (including any features, specifications and prices contained therein) provided by Home0001 for 0001 homes in its digital channels.

GeneralPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service. The data Home0001 collects from you will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and available on our website at www.home0001.com/legal/#privacy-policy and www.home0001.com/legal/#terms-of-service. Please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service carefully to understand the data that we collect and our practices regarding your information and how it will be treated. If you have questions, you may contact Home0001 by following the instructions on www.home0001.com/contact​.No Waiver; Amendments; Severability. The failure of Home0001 to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the provisions of these Deposit Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provisions. No amendment, modification, or waiver of these Deposit Terms will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by Home0001. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in these Deposit Terms is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision (1) will be automatically construed and adjusted in a manner which enables it to be valid and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law and which most nearly effects the parties’ intent in entering into these Deposit Terms, and (2) will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of these Deposit Terms.Assignment. You may not assign (directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) or delegate these Deposit Terms or your rights or obligations under these Deposit Terms without the written consent of Home0001. Any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Home0001 may freely assign and delegate these Deposit Terms and these Deposit Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of Home0001’s successors and assigns, including without limitation, any entity into which Home0001 will merge or consolidate. Any assignment in violation of these Deposit Terms will be null and void.Applicable Law and Venue. These Deposit Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Home0001, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Home0001 and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.Entire Agreement. These Deposit Terms, your Deposit Confirmation, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy will constitute the entire agreement between you and Home0001 with respect to the matters contained in these Deposit Terms, and will supersede any other prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral or written agreements, understandings or communications relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between these Deposit Terms, Home0001’s Terms of Service, and Home0001’s Privacy Policy, these Deposit Terms shall prevail.Printed Agreement. A printed version of these Deposit Terms and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Deposit Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.CONTACTING USHOME0001 International Inc., located at 80 State St., Albany, NY 12207 United States, is the company responsible for collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, Website Terms and Services, or Deposit Terms and Services, please contact us at collective@home0001.com.Because email communications are not always secure, please do not include credit card or other sensitive information in your emails to us.© 2024 HOME0001New york · los angeles · berlin · london · paris · mexico city0001 GDShow it workscontact usInstagramlegalCookies Settings© 2024 HOME0001NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #01427385NY DRE #10351211814CA DRE #02236922WE USE COOKIES.Accept/Reject/Settings [{'source': 'https://www.home0001.com/legal', 'title': 'Legal Notices for 0001 homes live flexibly own your home', 'description': 'Own the perfect home.', 'language': 'en'}]\n",
